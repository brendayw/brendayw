- 👋 Hi, I’m Brenda and I´m from Argentina. I discovered coding when I was around 12 or 13 years old out of curioscity but didn´t really know it was something you could learn in academys or even at uni. Now I´m 24 years old and decided to do a career switch and give web desing and programming a chance.
- 👀 I’m interested in sports and nutrition (I´m kind of a gym rat), manifestation and desing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5, CSS, JS AJAX, PHP and MySQL thru different proyects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate and learn new things thru this website and others
- 📫 How to reach me: you can find me on ig (@brenda.yw) and email (brendayw97@gmail.com)
